# Joke Historical Quote Generator


## About this project

This project takes a photo of a famous historical figure and adds on to it a quote by somebody else and an incorrect attribution, just like the Wrong Historical Quote memes.
For example, a Michael Scott quote from the office attributed to Gandhi and superimposed over a picture of Abraham Lincoln.
Enjoy!
